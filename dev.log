                ^

Error: 
You installed workerd on another platform than the one you're currently using.
This won't work because workerd is written with native code and needs to
install a platform-specific binary executable.

Specifically the "@cloudflare/workerd-windows-64" package is present but this platform
needs the "@cloudflare/workerd-linux-64" package instead. People often get into this
situation by installing workerd on macOS and copying "node_modules"
into a Docker image that runs Linux.

If you are installing with npm, you can try not copying the "node_modules"
directory when you copy the files over, and running "npm ci" or "npm install"
on the destination platform after the copy. Or you could consider using yarn
instead which has built-in support for installing a package on multiple
platforms simultaneously.

If you are installing with yarn, you can try listing both this platform and the
other platform in your ".yarnrc.yml" file using the "supportedArchitectures"
feature: https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/yarnrc/#supportedArchitectures
Keep in mind that this means multiple copies of workerd will be present.
